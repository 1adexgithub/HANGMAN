# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

If you intend to clone and work the file, note that the node_modules has been remoted to LFS and should the code not run perfectly, run 'npm install' or 'yarn install' to reinstall.
WORD/EXERCISE GENERATING API STILL AT LARGE.... Kindly find alternatives too as i am looking for one too.
